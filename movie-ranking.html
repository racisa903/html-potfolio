<h1> Best Must Watch Movies EVER!!!</h1>

<h3>#1  Mitchells vs Machines</h3>
<p>A funny movie about how a family of four tries to manage when robots take over.</p>

<h3>#2  Home</h3> 
The story of a left out alien, whose pals are trying to take over the world. He befreinds a human girl, who helps him stop his pals from taking over the world.


<h3>Nicky, Ricky, Dicky, and Dawn</h3>
This is a series, but I hope it still counts. A family of six encounters many different stages in life, but the way the deal with them is true comedy.
